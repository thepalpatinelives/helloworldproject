<h1>hello-world</h1>

<p>This is a test repository for educational intent.
 This line was added as an addition, and the app Sublime Text was utilized.
 This line was added on the github website, rather than the app. I now have to click COMMIT CHANGES.
 I then went into Github Desktop and clicked Repository - PULL and then opened the file in Sublime Text, seeing the change I made from the Github website. Now I'm going to PUSH the file back to the site after adding this new text from Sublime. PUSH did not change the file on the website, or so it appears after refreshing the link. Now I've made a second edit using Sublime and I'll hit COMMIT TO README-EDITS in the bottom left of Github Desktop and see what happens. That worked, and the text updated. ONE NOTE: After clicking COMMIT TO README-EDITS, I then had to select PUSH ORIGIN the file to the Github site. I'll do this again right now to confirm. Yup, that works. </p>

<h1>Breaking Good SAMPLE TEXT performed on the Github website. This created an enlarged, bolded headline.</h1>

<p>I put a space before this sentence to establish a distinct paragraph, rather than continue in the enlarged, bold headline. Let's try another COMMIT TO README-EDITS and PUSH ORIGIN, after saving this file in Sublime. </p>
